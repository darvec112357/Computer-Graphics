	<h2>Part 1: Preliminaries</h2>

	<p>After following the instructions, I successfully rendered ajax-normals. This task took me one day.</p>

	<h2>Part 2: Average Visiblity Integrator</h2>

	<p> To implement AV Integrator, I found the first intersection point. Then I used its normal and the provided sampler to sample a new 
        vector from the hemisphere. After that I constructed a second ray using the intersection point and the sampled vector and found the 
        second intersection. White is returned if any of the two rays does not have an intersection, black otherwise.
        The rendering process took quite a while (about 5-10 min), but in the end I managed to render both ajax-av 
        and sponza-av. I also passed the test in test-av. At first my image is darker than the reference image. This is because
        some of the ray will go below (due to calculation rounding error) the surface and the second ray will be blocked by the surface.
        Setting an Epsilon as second ray's mint addresses the problem. This task took me one day.
    </p>

	<h2>Part 3: Analytic Sphere Shape</h2>

	<p> To check ray intersection, I combined the analytic equations for sphere and ray to form a quadratic equation. It's worth noting that
        using dot products is much more convenient than extracting x,y,z values separately and perform algebraic works. I first check 
        that the discriminant is non-negative, then considered the three separate cases shown in lecture slides. For the method 
        setHitInformation(), the direction of the normal should be pointing away from the center. In addition, the normal vector should 
        be normalized (otherwise the resulting sphere will be brighter). As a result, I can render both sphere-analytics and sphere-mesh. 
        This task took me one day.
    </p>

    <h2>Part 4: Direct Illumination Integrator</h2>

    <p> For pointlight.cpp, I set the value for source position, incoming direction and shadowRay in the method sample(). I used the method eval() to
        calculate the radiance. The formula is given by power/4*pi*r*r, where r is the distance between the pointlight and the first intersection point. 
        The method pdf() is not relevant for this task, so I just returned 1.0. For direct.cpp, I first generate a EmitterQueryRecord 
        only using the point of intersection. Then I set the reverse direction of the ray as the outgoing direction as I am tracing from
        the perspective of eyes. After that I iterated through all pointlights generated in the scene, computing its radiance, followed by 
        generating a BSDF record and calculating the bsdf value. The cosine value is calculated using the dot product of normalized intersection
        normals and incoming ray. The color is updated after each iteration of pointlight. In the end, I 
        successfully rendered sponza-direct and also passed both test (test-direct & test-sponza). This task took me three days.

    <h2>Part 5: Texture Mapping</h2>

    <p>Firstly, I scaled the uv coordinate to the range [0,1]. To achieve this, I divided the value of u by 2*pi and divided the
        value of (v-pi) by pi. Next, I divided the scaled uv coordinate by m_scale and added the value of m_delta. Then I rounded
        up the values to the nearest integer. Finally, I set 
        the color to be white if the x-y coordinate has the same parity, black otherwise. My implementation was able to render mesh-texture 
        correctly, but not sphere-texture. I found out that the issue was in my implementation of sphere.cpp, that I failed to consider
        the intersection cases comprehensively. After fixing the problem in sphere.cpp, I managed to render sphere-texture. This task took me
        two days.</p>
